    <p class="message">
      I’m sorry, once again, for making you feel sad on a day that should have been filled with happiness.
      I truly apologize for not being able to give you the joy you deserved.
      <br><br>

      I hope you are happy with your life, your career, and your family not just tomorrow, but in all the days to come.
      I’m sorry if my presence in your life brought more pain than happiness.
      That was never my intention, but I understand that intentions don’t always ease feelings.
      <br><br>

      I pray that you live your best life and find the peace and happiness you deserve.
      <br><br>

      Untuk terakhirnya, saya sayang awak ya.
